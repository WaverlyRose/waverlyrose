**AI Engineer & Scientist · Surgical Data Science · Healthcare Equity**

I build AI systems that sit *inside* real clinical workflows — from ORs to tumor boards — to improve surgical precision, tumor characterization, and operating room efficiency.

## 🔭 What I'm Working On

- 🧠 AI Engineer – Neurosurgery (Spine Tumor Boards) – Productionizing a privacy-safe LLM/RAG service that ingests charts, imaging impressions, pathology, and guidelines into one-page, FHIR-like decision briefs with full citations, built on Go-based orchestration, FastAPI/Pydantic, Postgres/pgvector, and AWS (S3, ECR, EKS) with Kubernetes, Docker, and Grafana for SRE-grade observability.
- 🎓 M.S. in Artificial Intelligence, Johns Hopkins University (May 2027, in progress) – Completing a rigorous online AI curriculum (ML, NLP, robotics, and image processing) through Engineering for Professionals while working full time, with a focus on designing production-grade AI systems that can be deployed safely and reliably in real-world clinical workflows.

## 🧰 Technical Stack

- **Languages**: Python (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy), a bit of R and MATLAB
- **ML / DL**: PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, classical CV pipelines, deep CV for surgical video
- **Data & Infra**: Docker, GitHub Actions, HPC clusters, AWS
- **Analytics & Viz**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, custom dashboards for OR analytics

## 📚 Selected Publications & Work

I focus heavily on **machine learning for neuro-oncology** and **reporting quality / bias in ML for medicine**.

- Machine learning for differentiating **glioma vs brain metastasis** – systematic reviews and TRIPOD-based quality assessments  
- Reviews of ML and deep learning for **glioma grading, segmentation, and subtype prediction**  
- Ongoing work on **fair, interpretable clinical ML** in imaging-based workflows  

👉 You can find the full list on **[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VwZLAXoAAAAJ&hl=en)**.

## 🚀 Highlight Projects

- **Circlage – Surgical Skill Assessment Platform**  
  Computer vision + UX for video-based cataract surgery skill assessment and OR utilization analytics.  
  *Role*: R&D, model development, product design, and clinical–technical translation.

- **Meningioma Microenvironment ML Pipeline**  
  ML + CV workflows for subcellular structure detection, segmentation, and genomic data visualization to support neurosurgical teams.

## 🤝 How I Like to Collaborate

- Translational projects at the **interface of ML and clinical practice**  
- Teams that care about **reporting standards, bias assessment, and real-world deployment**, not just leaderboard metrics  
- Strong preference for projects that move us toward **equitable and explainable AI in healthcare**

If that sounds like your team or project, let’s talk.
